      "As more people are shopping online while trying to avoid crowded stores, they are easier prey for hackers and scammers. A Google study conducted in 2019 found that 52% of individuals use one password on many sites and 13% admit they use one password for everything. Also, more than 2.5 billion accounts were estimated to have been hacked in 2018, which amounts to around 6.85 million accounts being hacked each day, or roughly 158 every second. Every 2 out of 5 individuals have been a victim of identity theft, had their passwords compromised, or their sensitive information breached due to having outdated or duplicate passwords. And finally, poor password security is the cause of more than 80% of data breaches.",
